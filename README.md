# weather-app

### [Check out online](https://objective-kowalevski-3e25b2.netlify.com/).

This application was built with `HTML, CSS, JavaScript` and it uses the `MVC architecture pattern`.
The user can look at the forecast by searching for a city or based on the location they are at.

For the weather data I'm using the `openweathermap.org API`.
